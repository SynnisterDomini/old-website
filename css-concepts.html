	 <hr>

	<section class = "statement">	
		<p> In css there are 4 types of positioning. There's static, or the default positioning, relative positioning, fixed positioning, and absolute positioning. They're all extremely useful in their own ways in making quality websites in css. </p>
		<p> Static positioning is the easiest to understand of the 4. It's the default positioning, meaning that static objects are simply placed under each other in a website. Object 1 will be on top of object 2, and so on. </p>
		<p> Relative positioning is just like static positioning, if no modifiers are applied. However, elements with relative positioning can be moved from their original location. They can be moved up, down left, or right depending on what is specified after declaring that the elemnt has relative positioning. </p>
		<p> Fixed positioning is actually very easy to understand. An element that has fixed positioning will remain in whatever position it is in the website browser, no matter how you scroll. </p>
		<p> Absolute positioning is the hardest to understand, because it's like a version of relative positioning in relative positioning. An element with absolute positioning will positioned as if the last object referred to was it's own window in a browser.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing was fun, we got to bounce ideas off of one another.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes. It gives me a visual representation of my goal that I can refer to using HTML, which is really easy because HTML follows the visual representation quite well.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

A good wireframe presents the information required, while giving the user the ability to navigate freely throughout the rest of the webpage.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
I did not learn new semantic elements.
