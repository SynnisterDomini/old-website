What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that even when you position elements using relative positioning, you still have to mess with margins and borders in order to position your elements correctly. I also learned that making borders visible (using boxview) is very useful for positioning elements.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning can be frustrating because you need to keep in mind what elements you want to be fixed and what elements you want to be releative.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I thought the hardest part of my design was getting the sidebar to load properly, and also implementing the correct tags. The easiest part was changing background colors and font styles.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I don't feel like I learned much in regards to formatting elements, I have more trouble with positioning in css than I do with formatting elements because formatting is very similar to how it is done in HTML.
