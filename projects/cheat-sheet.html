		Alright. Loops. Loops are always fun, given that they allow us to iterate through every portion of an array or object. I had the pleasure of learing about loops through python, but ruby betenumerables were super useful in shortcutting the process. In particular, .each and .map! were absolutely amazing.

		<p>
		Here's a ruby loop for reference:
		</p>
		<code>
			<p>numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</p>
			<p>numbers.map! {|x| x*3}</p>
			<p>p numbers => [3,6,9,12,15,18,21]</p>
		</code>
		<p>
		In order to do the same thing in javascript, you need to input as follows:
		</p>
		<code>
			<p>var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];</p>
			<p>for (var begin = 0; begin < numbers.length; begin++){</p>
				<p>numbers[begin] = numbers[begin]*3;</p>
			<p>}</p>
			<p>console.log(numbers);</p>
		</code>
		<p> It seems counterintuitive, but the logic is sound. The loop works by creating a variable that counts through the array and performs the required action until
