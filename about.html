		<h1> About me! </h1>
		<section>
		<p>
			I'm a graduate of UC Davis with a BS in Psychology. I'm currently enrolled in DevBootcamp and plan to attend their phase 1 on November 9, 2015. Aside from currently learning ruby, I've also completed Coursera's Introduction to Coding in Python.

			I currently work as a senior counselor for a group home for foster kids in San Jose. I've been at the company for about eighteen months, but I haven't been able to progress. As a result, I'm looking to gain some useful skills and hopefully obtain a job that will let me survive in the extremely expensive bay area.

			Tradition dictates that I state something quirky about myself. I'm not sure how quirky this is, but I do believe it's odd that I'm extremely facinated with cats even though I am extremely allergic to them.
