      	Woo! Taking a look at classes now. Classes are a way of bundling up a variety of methods in a variable, and they're an integral part of object oriented programming. The best way to understand objects and classes is to relate them to an everyday object and code in a manner that is easy to understand. The following is a code for a die.
      </p>
        <pre><code>
class Die
  def initialize(number_of_sides)
    @faces = number_of_sides
    if number_of_sides < 1
      raise ArgumentError.new("Must have sides greater than or equal to 1.")
    end
  end

  def sides
    return @faces
  end

  def roll
    return 1 + rand(@faces)
  end
end</code></pre>
      <p>
        Note that the die has an initialize method. The initialize method is how the original arguments are presented when creating a new object with that class. Creating a new object for a die would be as follows.
      </p>
      <code>
      	20_sided_die = Die.new(20)
       </code>

      <p>
        At this point, a new object has been created that's a die with 20 sides. If I call the roll method for that die using 
    </p>
    <code>
      	20_sided_die.roll
       </code>
       <p>
       	the code will then give me a random number between 1 and 20, just like when I roll an actual 20 sided die. This is just the beginning of what classes and objects are capable, of, but hopefully you're starting to see the potential!
