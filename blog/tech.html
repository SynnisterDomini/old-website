    Here I'm gonna talk a bit about how a computer works. I can't call myself an expert, but I really enjoy working with technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computers are composed of multiple parts, but the most basic necessities a personal computer needs are a motherboard, a CPU, a hard drive, a power supply + fans, and RAM. The rest of the peripherals are usually optional.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most essential part of a computer is the motherboard. The motherboard pretty much serves as the nerves of the computer, it allows for all the parts of the computer to talk to each other. It is also one of the hardest parts of the computer to replace. Every component of the computer plugs into the motherboard at some point.

    The CPU (Cetral Processing Unit) of the computer is essentially the brain. It handles the essential computations necessary to perform almost all functions within the computer. CPU values are compared in two ways: by the amount of cores they have, and their processing speeds in hertz. The processing speed is relatively self explanatory, but the cores are another story. CPU cores are essentially independent thinking units withn the CPU itself. Each individual core processes just as fast as the original CPU, but because they're independent, they can all perform different processes at the same time. Because of this, multi-core CPUs are almost always better than a single core CPU with the same processing power.

    The hard drive is where data that needs to be kept is stored and saved. There are primarily 2 types of hard drives; spinning disk and solid state (SSD). Spinning disk drives, as their name implies, have a spinning disk within them that has data written on it, so the drive can access the data later when necessary. Sometimes you can audibly hear the motor of the drive activate when you're attempting to access information. SSDs, on the other hand, don't use any spinning disks, and instead have grids of empty data which absorb electrons to write their data. Because SSDs have no moving parts, they're thousands of times faster than spining disk drives.

    The power supply, fans, and RAM of the computer are less complicated, but still essential to a computer. First and foremost, RAM (random access memory) is very fast temporary storage for computers. If a computer needs to store a local variable for a computation, it will store it in the RAM because the information is useless after the process is finished, and RAM is designed to be quick to access. The power supply provides power to the various parts of the computer, and the fans provide a decent airflow in order to ensure that essential components (like the CPU) don't overheat.
