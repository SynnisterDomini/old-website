      Today we learned about Arrays and Hashes. I've programmed in python before, so I was familar with how to store information in both of them. However, the syntax is a little different from Python, and I had to learn the differences through trial and error. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays and Hashes are basically just ways to store information. Arrays pair the information to a specific number (starting from 0, then going upwards to infinity from there), and Hashes pair the information to a keyword that the user assigns. It's great if you're trying to store password information or account information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We actually use and call arrays for special characters. Every time you press alt + (a 3 digit number) in order to make a special character, you're accessing a specific id number for an array in order for your program to return a special character (like a copywrite symbol) to you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hashes are more for storing information that you want to remember. Specifically, they're easier to understand than arrays because rather than having information tied to a number, it's instead tied to a word-pair. You can keep a list of personal achievements, or perhaps list your favorite greeting and your favorite goodbye. Both hashes and arrays are quite useful!
