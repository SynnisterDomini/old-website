      Today I will be answering these three questions to the best of my ability in my blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What are the benefits of version control?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How does git help you keep track of changes?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why use GitHub to store your code?"
    </p>
    <p>
        In regards to the first question, I must first answer what version control is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version control is a form of computing that keeps a system consisting of many versions of the same piece of software configurations well organized (taken from google). Version control is beneficial because it allows users to backtrack and reset the software if a critical error is created. Having access to a previous, more functional version of the software is very beneficial towards finding out what went wrong with the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git is a VCS (version control software) that many developers use in order to keep their various versions of software in order. Git allows users to create "brances" of code from a master template, work on those branches, and then merge the branch back into the master. It is a system that allows multiple developers to modify the same line of code without stepping on each other's toes.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub is a website that allows multiple users to create or fork repositories, which allow developers to make their own master branches of code from another developer's repository that they can modify as they wish. Code stored on GitHub can be labeled as public or private, to help ensure privacy. It is recommended to store code on GitHub because it makes the code easily acessible and allows code to be modified through git on a global scale.
