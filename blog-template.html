How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing was fun, we got to bounce ideas off of one another.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes. It gives me a visual representation of my goal that I can refer to using HTML, which is really easy because HTML follows the visual representation quite well.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

A good wireframe presents the information required, while giving the user the ability to navigate freely throughout the rest of the webpage.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
I did not learn new semantic elements.
